A fun educational fishing game designed for KS3 science students to learn about chemical elements and the periodic table.

## About

AtomicFisher is an interactive MATLAB App Designer game where players control a fishing hook to catch fish carrying non-metal elements. The game helps students distinguish between metals and non-metals in a fun, engaging way.

## Features

- **Educational Gameplay**: Learn to identify non-metal elements (H, He, C, O)
- **Interactive Controls**: Use arrow keys to move the fishing hook and spacebar to catch fish
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for correct catches, lose points for mistakes
- **Star Rating**: Achieve up to 3 stars based on your performance
- **Timer Challenge**: Complete the level within the time limit

## Requirements

- MATLAB 2024b (may not work on previous versions)
- MATLAB App Designer

## Installation & Running

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Ensure all files are in the same directory, maintaining the folder structure
3. Open MATLAB 2024b
4. Navigate to the project folder
5. Double-click `AtomicFisher.mlapp` to open in App Designer
6. Click the "Run" button in App Designer, or
7. Type `AtomicFisher` in the MATLAB command window

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Catch only the fish carrying non-metal elements
2. **Controls**:
   - Arrow keys: Move the fishing hook
   - Spacebar: Release/catch the hooked fish
   - Click background: Pause the game
3. **Scoring**:
   - +100 points for each correct catch
   - -50 points for catching wrong elements
4. **Elements to catch**: H (Hydrogen), He (Helium), C (Carbon), O (Oxygen)
5. **Elements to avoid**: Na (Sodium), Fe (Iron), K (Potassium)

## Game Mechanics

- Fish spawn randomly with different elements
- Hook must touch the fish to catch it
- Bring caught fish back to the boat (hook above boat level) to score
- Game speed increases as you progress
- 60 seconds time limit per level

## Star System

- ⭐ 1 Star: 175+ points
- ⭐⭐ 2 Stars: 325+ points  
- ⭐⭐⭐ 3 Stars: 475+ points
