## 📖 About

AtomicFisher is an interactive MATLAB App Designer game where players control a fishing hook 🪝 to catch fish 🐟 carrying non-metal elements. The game helps students distinguish between metals and non-metals in a fun, engaging way! 🎯

## ✨ Features

- **🎓 Educational Gameplay**: Learn to identify non-metal elements (H, He, C, O)
- **🎮 Interactive Controls**: Use arrow keys to move the fishing hook and spacebar to catch fish
- **🏆 Scoring System**: Earn points for correct catches, lose points for mistakes
- **⭐ Star Rating**: Achieve up to 3 stars based on your performance
- **⏰ Timer Challenge**: Complete the level within the time limit

## 💻 Requirements

- MATLAB 2024b (may not work on previous versions) 🔧
- MATLAB App Designer 🛠️

## 🚀 Installation & Running

1. 📥 Download or clone this repository
2. 📁 Ensure all files are in the same directory, maintaining the folder structure
3. 🔧 Open MATLAB 2024b
4. 📂 Navigate to the project folder
5. 🖱️ Double-click `AtomicFisher.mlapp` to open in App Designer
6. ▶️ Click the "Run" button in App Designer, or
7. ⌨️ Type `AtomicFisher` in the MATLAB command window

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **🎯 Objective**: Catch only the fish carrying non-metal elements
2. **🎮 Controls**:
   - ⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️ Arrow keys: Move the fishing hook
   - 🚀 Spacebar: Release/catch the hooked fish
   - 🖱️ Click background: Pause the game
3. **🏆 Scoring**:
   - ➕100 points for each correct catch ✅
   - ➖50 points for catching wrong elements ❌
4. **🎯 Elements to catch**: H (Hydrogen), He (Helium), C (Carbon), O (Oxygen) ✅
5. **⚠️ Elements to avoid**: Na (Sodium), Fe (Iron), K (Potassium) ❌

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics
